# PCH-S22
This project is created as the final assignment of INFO-664: Programming Cultural Heritage. I utilized the data from NYC open data to generate visual elements to present the analysis of film permits issued by the NYC government, which are generally required when asserting the exclusive use of city property, like a sidewalk, a street, or a park.

•	Unzip the data file
•	Run Jupyter Notebook (primary computing platform)
•	Read csv file as a pandas dataframe object
•	Drop nan values in the dataframe
•	Split zip codes
•	Create Pie charts to see the relationship between event type and category
•	Create a bar chart to show event type distribution for each category
•	Use geojson file to generate a heat map
